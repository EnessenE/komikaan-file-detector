### The komikaan file detector
This service is responsible for checking if GTFS schedules/files have been updated since the last time we imported them. Incase these weren't it notifies a harvester to start an import.

Part of the overal komikaan.nl project, for more info see: [komikaan, the main repo](https://github.com/EnessenE/komikaan).
